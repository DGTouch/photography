# Photography

This repository contains files related to my photography post processing
workflow. Note that the example images might have slight tweaks after
the preset has been applied. YMMV.

## My Lightroom presets

 All of them have lens correction enabled.

### X100 Bandhagen [Bright, Muted]

 Really washed out colors, pale skin tones and split toned.

### X100 Stockholm

 Sharper than X100 Gothenburg, less vibrant but more clarity. (Might need some refinements)
